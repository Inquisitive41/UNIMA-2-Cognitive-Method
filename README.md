## Overview

**UNIMA-2** is a cognitive AI algorithm designed for hypothesis generation, evaluation, and adaptation using minimal computational resources. The method is tailored for embedded systems, transparent decision-making, and scenarios where conventional neural networks are impractical.

Key Features:

* Logical and statistical hypothesis generation
* Minimal query testing with real-time feedback
* Energy-efficient design
* Human-readable explanations via graphs and text
* Suitable for edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi)

## Core Concepts

### Algorithmic Flow:

1. **Hypothesis Generation** – Based on labeled input features.
2. **Scoring** – Uses a balance of coverage, generality, complexity, and energy.
3. **Minimal Testing** – Efficiently validates with 1–3 examples.
4. **Adaptation** – Lightweight weight updates for continual learning.
5. **Explanation** – Outputs graph-based and natural language justifications.

## Example Usage

```python
from unima2 import UNIMA2

unima = UNIMA2()

# Training examples
examples = [
    ({"color": "red", "shape": "circle"}, "A"),
    ({"color": "green", "shape": "square"}, "A")
]

unima.generate_hypotheses(examples)

# Evaluate hypotheses
for hyp in unima.hypotheses:
    unima.evaluate_hypothesis(hyp, examples)

# Test with a new sample
new_input = {"color": "green", "shape": "circle"}
unima.adapt(new_input, "A", feedback=1)
print(unima.predict(new_input))
print(unima.explain(new_input))

# Visualize hypothesis graph
unima.visualize()
```

## Performance

* ✅ Accuracy: \~95% on test cases
* ⚡ Inference Speed: 120ms on Raspberry Pi 4
* 🔍 Transparent: Outputs clear logical reasoning and visual graphs
* 💡 Lightweight: Minimal hardware required for deployment

---

## Mathematical Foundations

* **Bayesian Inference** for probability estimation
* **Energy-aware Scoring**:

  ```
  Score(H) = (Coverage × Generality) / (Complexity × Energy)
  ```

---

## Applications

* Embedded AI systems
* Decision support in constrained environments
* Explainable AI for education, diagnostics, and edge AI tasks
